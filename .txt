1 - I want to create a wallet for my server
2 - Generate different addresses when a player call the generate address url
3 - Allow them to pay into the address generated
4 - Let them stake base on the amount paid into the address
5 - Confirm the payment has been made using a blockexplorer using the txhash .
6 - check the address they provided when they are staking if it matches the address in the transaction object
7 - if the win I pay them back the 150% of the amount they staked
