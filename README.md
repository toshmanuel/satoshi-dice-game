For a player to win, they need to guess a number and the number guessed must be between 1-100 (inclusive) and the number must be less or equal to the number generated by the system. Likewise, before a user can play on the application they have to pay thier stake into the address generated by the server which is different everytime a player wants to play or even for different users. After a successful payment and at least one block confirmation of the transaction, the user can use the transaction id generated after successful payment to play on the application.
